# Types in Dart

**Basic Dart Code**

```dart

void main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
    print('hello ${i + 1}');
  }
}

```

**Another example**

```dart

void main(){

var name = myName();

print ('My name is ${name}');

}

String myName(){

return "Varma";

}

- Every value has a type
- Every variable has a type it can refer to
- Once a variable type is associated it cant be changed
