# Functions

In Dart, the main() function is a special function that is used to start the execution of a Dart program. It is the entry point for the program, and it is the place where you can define the code that you want your program to run.

The void keyword in Dart indicates that the main() function does not return a value. This is because the main function is not expected to return any data to the operating system. Its purpose is simply to run the program and execute the code that is defined within it.

``` dart

void main(){

var name = myName();

print('my name is $name');

}

String myName(){

return 'Varma';

}

```
